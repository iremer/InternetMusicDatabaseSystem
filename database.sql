The \"Smooth Criminal\" single hit No. 1 in Spain and The Netherlands and reached the Top 10 in the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. In the United States, \"Smooth Criminal\" reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100-the sixth single from Bad to do so-as well as Billboard\'s Hot Dance Club Play and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles charts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a standalone short film, \"Smooth Criminal\" became the centerpiece of Michael\'s most ambitious film project at the time, Moonwalker, a feature-length film that was released theatrically in various countries outside of the United States. In the \"Smooth Criminal\" portion of the film, Michael and his friends face off against the notorious drug lord Mr. Big (Joe Pesci) and attempt to foil his plot to get the children of the world hooked on drugs-but of course, in the end, Michael defeats the villain.\r\n\r\nThe musical portion of \"Smooth Criminal\" takes place in the magical \"Club \'30s,\" where Michael instructed his friends to meet him. While Katie (Kellie Parker), Zeke (Brandon Adams) and Sean (Sean Lennon) find the club to belong abandoned, Club \'30s springs to life when Michael shows up, wearing a blue and white pinstripe suit and fedora.\r\n\r\nAs the kids watch through the window, Michael flips a coin into the jukebox and leads the club patrons through a dazzling performance to \"Smooth Criminal.\" Here, Michael shows off updated versions of his signature dance moves.

The single was released on May 29, 1995.\r\n\r\n\"Scream\" is an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. It was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&B, electrorock, dance-pop, and funk. Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records\' attempt to keep it off air until the release date.\r\n\r\nGenerally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other songs by Michael Jackson. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed; it won three MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\".\r\n\r\n\"Scream\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Italy, New Zealand, and Spain while reaching the top five in Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

It is a protest song and remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple clarifications, an apology, defense from director Spike Lee and re-releasing the song with a new vocal featuring altered lyrics. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately.\r\n\r\n\"They Don\'t Care About Us\" was accompanied by two music videos directed by Lee. The first was shot in two locations in Brazil, in Pelourinho, the historic city center of Salvador, and in a favela of Rio de Janeiro called Dona Marta, where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image, the area and prospects of Rio de Janeiro staging the 2004 Olympics. Still, the residents of the area were happy to see the singer, hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses.\r\n\r\nCommercially, \"They Don\'t Care About Us\" became a top ten hit in all European countries and number one in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Italy. In the US, the song peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100.\r\n\r\n\"They Don\'t Care About Us\" was performed as part of a medley with \"Scream\" and \"In the Closet\" during Jackson\'s third and final concert series, the HIStory World Tour, which ran from 1996 to 1997.

(1998). Written by Estéfano[2] and Shakira, it was released on September 7, 1998, as the lead single from the album. \"Ciega, Sordomuda\" is a Latin pop song, with prominent influences of mariachi, and the lyrics express her clumsy feeling when the person that she loves is near; she doesn\'t pay attention to their signals because she is completely blinded.\r\n\r\nThe song reached the number-one spot on Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart for three weeks in 1998, becoming Shakira\'s first single to do so. It was also a hit all over Latin America, reaching #1 in the charts of every single country. It also became one of the most successful Latin pop songs of the 1990s. It remains as one of Shakira\'s signature songs and has been performed several times since its release, most recently during her The Sun Comes Out World Tour.

Singer Shontelle and production duo R. City wrote the song with its main producer, Sham. They wrote it during a writing camp, in Los Angeles of March 2010, held by Rihanna\'s record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then-untitled album. Rock City were inspired by Bob Marley\'s 1973 song \"I Shot the Sheriff\" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective. \"Man Down\" is a reggae song which incorporates elements of ragga and electronic music. Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets. Several critics singled out \"Man Down\" as Loud\'s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.\r\n\r\nDef Jam released \"Man Down\" on May 3, 2011, as the fifth single from the album. In the United States, the single reached number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song topped the chart in France for five consecutive weeks and reached the top three in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anthony Mandler directed its music video, in which Rihanna\'s character shoots a man after he rapes her. The video was criticized by the Parents Television Council, Industry Ears and Mothers Against Violence, who faulted Rihanna for suggesting that murder is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims. However, actress Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, praised the video for being relatable. \"Man Down\" was on the set list for three of Rihanna\'s tours – the Loud Tour (2011), the Diamonds World Tour (2013) and the Anti World Tour (2016).', NULL),

In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Stan\" 296th on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, upping their ranking to 223rd in a 2021 updated list.

It was released on October 28, 2002, as the lead single from the soundtrack. The song\'s lyrics explicitly sum up the background of Eminem\'s character in 8 Mile, B-Rabbit, with the first verse summing up much of the plot of the movie. The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by B-Rabbit, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers.\r\n\r\n\"Lose Yourself\" was a commercial success, becoming Eminem\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and remaining there for twelve consecutive weeks. It reached atop of the charts in nineteen other countries. \"Lose Yourself\" received acclaim from music critics, with many critics praising the song\'s inspiring, aggressive themes and describing it as Eminem\'s best work to date. Eminem\'s rapping ability, the lyrics and the production were also praised. In many retrospective reviews and lists, critics have cited the song among Eminem\'s finest, as well as one of the greatest hip hop songs of all time.\r\n\r\nThe music video for the song, directed by Eminem, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. The video is a mixture of multiple scenarios, including scenes from and reminiscent of the movie 8 Mile, and Eminem rapping next to the \"8 Mile Rd. Mobile Court\" sign that appears on the cover of the movie\'s soundtrack. It received the MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.\r\n\r\n\"Lose Yourself\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making it the first hip hop song to receive the award, and also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Solo Performance.

The chorus is sung by Ruben and Jewell, and Snoop Dogg (then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg) raps the line \"Rollin\' in my 6-4\" and appears in some background vocals.\r\n\r\nDr. Dre\'s lyrics were written by RBX, originally intended for a different track. Dr. Dre, RBX and Snoop Dogg share songwriting credits for the song.\r\n\r\n\"Let Me Ride\"\'s chorus involves both a sample and an interpolation of the chorus of the 1976 Parliament song \"Mothership Connection (Star Child)\", which itself quotes the Negro spiritual \"Swing Down Sweet Chariot\". \"Let Me Ride\" also samples James Brown\'s \"Funky Drummer\" and Bill Withers\'s 1973 single \"Kissing My Love\".\r\n\r\nThe song makes a reference to popular rock band Aerosmith in the lyric \"and no, this ain\'t Aerosmith!\"\r\n\r\nHip Hop Dx placed the song on their list of 13 Great Hip Hop Songs For The Summer.', NULL),

The singer and songwriter Skylar Grey wrote and recorded a demo of the song alongside the producer Alex da Kid when she felt she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose Rihanna to sing the chorus, resulting in a collaboration influenced by their past experiences in difficult relationships. Recording sessions were held in Ferndale, Michigan, and Dublin, Ireland. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a midtempo hip-hop ballad with a pop refrain, sung by Rihanna, and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a dangerous love–hate relationship.\r\n\r\nInterscope Records released the song in August 2010 as the second single from Recovery. Critics praised its melody but were divided into thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the single with performances at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and festivals. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, stars Dominic Monaghan and Megan Fox in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna in front of a burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of domestic violence. Reporters suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem\'s and Rihanna\'s abusive relationships with their respective ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and Chris Brown.\r\n\r\nCritics listed \"Love the Way You Lie\" among the best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem\'s career. The song won many awards and received five Grammy nominations. It is Eminem\'s best-selling single and ranked number one on several record charts, including the United States\' Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks. The single sold over 12 million copies in the US and 1.5 million in the UK. Musical acts such as Cher Lloyd and the Band Perry have performed cover versions. Rihanna has said that the theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many people do not have insight, is what makes the song impactful. She later recorded \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", narrated mostly from her perspective.', 1),

It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by Capitol Records as the first promotional single from Perry\'s fourth studio album, Prism (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin, Cirkut, and Dr. Luke, alongside Sarah Hudson. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry\'s hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song.\r\n\r\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of trap, hip hop, pop-rap and electropop, replicating what has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry\'s vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song\'s intro and rapped bridge. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a witch warning a man not to fall in love with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by Pepsi in which fans could vote via Twitter on whether they would prefer either \"Dark Horse\" or \"Walking on Air\" to be released as the first promotional single from Prism.\r\n\r\n\"Dark Horse\" was a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. It also reached the top ten in almost 20 countries including New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden and Venezuela as well as the Digital Songs chart of Billboard magazine. Billboard credits \"Dark Horse\" for helping cement trap music\'s place on the charts. Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 20, 2013. The song\'s first major television performance was at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014. \"Dark Horse\" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has sold 13.2 million units (combined sales and track-equivalent streams), becoming the second best-selling song worldwide for 2014. As of 2019, it is one of the best selling songs in digital history.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Flame, a Christian rap artist, filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Perry and the other songwriters, claiming that \"Dark Horse\" copied from his 2008 song \"Joyful Noise\". On July 29, 2019, a federal jury ruled in favor of Flame and the co-plaintiffs Da\' T.R.U.T.H. and Chike Ojukwu. The jury ordered Perry, her collaborators, and associated labels to pay $2.78 million in damages. Of this, Perry was ordered to pay $550,000. However, in part due to a similar judgement that found Led Zeppelin\'s \"Stairway to Heaven\" clear of copyright infringement in the Ninth Circuit, the jury award was vacated on appeal in March 2020.', NULL),

Reviewers speculated that the song was also about the 2016 United States presidential election nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nMusic critics gave mixed reviews of \"Hey Hey Hey\", with some praising it as one of the highlights of Witness and others deeming it mediocre and a failed attempt at duplicating the success of Perry\'s older hits.

To accompany the track, a music video was uploaded onto Perry\'s official YouTube account on December 20, 2017. The clip was filmed by Isaac Rentz in Beverly Hills, California and is set in the 18th century and the Ancien Régime, with the singer\'s outfits resembling those of the last Queen of France Marie Antoinette and French heroine Joan of Arc. For further promotion, Perry gave several live performances of \"Hey Hey Hey\", including those during her concert tour Witness: The Tour (2017–2018) and her four-day YouTube live stream Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide (2017). Commercially, the song appeared on charts in Czech Republic, New Zealand and Sweden.', NULL),

It was written by Perry, Duke Dumont, Sarah Hudson, PJ \"Promnite\" Sledge, Minaj and Brittany Hazzard, while being produced by Dumont, with additional production by Sledge and Noah \"Mailbox\" Passovoy and vocal production by Passovoy. The song was initially released as a promotional single on May 19, 2017, and later as the album\'s third single. \"Swish Swish\" is a house-inspired EDM and hip hop song that samples \"I Get Deep\" by Roland Clark.\r\n\r\nA song about fighting against bullies, \"Swish Swish\" uses basketball metaphors to talk about overcoming hateful people and thriving. Multiple media outlets suspected that the song was a response to Taylor Swift\'s \"Bad Blood\", which was believed to be about Perry. At release, critics were divided with \"Swish Swish\" as some praised the track\'s empowering environment while others criticized its lyrics. However, Minaj\'s verse was positively received. Retrospectively however, \"Swish Swish\" has been cited as one of Perry\'s best songs by critics, praising the song\'s tribute to 1990s house music.\r\n\r\nCommercially, \"Swish Swish\" was an international success, reaching the top 10 in the Philippines and Scotland, the top 20 in Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, and the top 30 in Australia, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

Subsequently, Perry continued to promote the track during BBC Radio 1\'s Big Weekend, the Glastonbury Festival 2017 and The Voice Australia. Later, to further promote the track, a lyric video for the track, featuring Brazilian singer Gretchen, was released on July 3, 2017. The official music video, directed by Dave Meyers, premiered on August 24, 2017. Three days later, Perry and Minaj performed the track together for the first time during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Swish Swish\" is featured in the video game Just Dance 2018, with its dance choreography also appearing in its music video.', 1),

The production was handled by West, with an extended outro co-produced with Mike Dean. The composition is electronic in nature, employing synthesizers as its prominent instrument. For the track, West utilizes a vocal sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" by French house duo Daft Punk. On \"Stronger\", West speaks about the resolve that comes when one is faced with adversity, with lyrics at the song\'s refrain that paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche\'s dictum \"What does not kill me makes me stronger\". West also describes \"Stronger\" as an \"emancipation\", using the track to vent his frustration over mistakes he made in the past year.\r\n\r\nThe song\'s production process was arduous, with West and his team mixing the track reportedly over 75 times, including after its release as a single. Although he worked with eight audio engineers and eleven mix engineers around the world for the track, West still felt dissatisfied with the results and decided to enlist the aid of record producer Timbaland in redoing its drum programming prior to the release of Graduation. West felt \"Stronger\" paled in comparison to the sampled original, but Daft Punk were delighted by the song, leading to future collaborations. The single\'s music video was directed by Hype Williams, features sci-fi imagery based on the 1988 anime film Akira, and was shot largely in Tokyo, Japan. Kanye West\'s use of shutter shades in the music video became a signature of his in the late 2000s.\r\n\r\nReleased as a single on July 31, 2007, \"Stronger\" would top the Billboard Hot 100 several weeks later, becoming West\'s third number-one single. It was a top ten single in ten countries, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States. The song was praised by music critics. It was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards, and was named as one of the best songs of the year by Rolling Stone and Spin. The song\'s popularity has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the ensuing years. \"Stronger\" has since sold five million copies in the United States, and has been certified Diamond by the RIAA, making it one of the best-selling singles in the United States.', NULL),
